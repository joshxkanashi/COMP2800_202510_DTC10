## Project Pitch
Due to the rising cost of living in Vancouver, we are creating a financial tracking app that is catered towards students to help them save and keep track of their student loans.

## Description
Computer science students struggle to effectively showcase their skills and projects to potential employers. Traditional platforms like LinkedIn arenâ€™t built for technical portfolios, while personal websites offer little support or connection. As it becomes increasingly difficult for tech graduates to break into the industry, we are building an application that helps computer science students showcase their skills through intelligent, career-driven portfolios.
